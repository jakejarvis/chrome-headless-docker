# Google Chrome Headless for Docker

This Docker image contains Google Chrome (stable) for Debian, with its required dependencies included and an entrypoint to start Chrome in headless mode.

Mainly for use as a backbone for my [GitHub Action for Lighthouse audits](https://github.com/jakejarvis/lighthouse-action).
